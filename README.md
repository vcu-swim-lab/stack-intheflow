### Sort & Filter
Refine your searches by sorting by different metrics and filtering by specific tags. If you never want to leave the comfort of your keyboard, you can even press `<TAB>` to add the previous word as a tag.

### Running in Android Studio
In order to run StackInTheFlow within Android Studio you must set the `STUDIO_JDK` environment variable to point to an Oracle JDK installation on your machine. You can read about setting Android Studio environment variables [here](https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/variables.html#set).  
For example on Windows in the command prompt you would run:
```
set STUDIO_JDK="C:\Program Files\Java\jdk_version_something"
```
Alternatively you can:
 * Search for System (Control Panel)
 * Click **Advanced Systems Settings**
 * In **System Variables** select **New**
 * Set `STUDIO_JDK` to point to where the JDK software is located, for example, C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0_144.
